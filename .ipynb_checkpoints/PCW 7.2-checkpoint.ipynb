In the file $\\textit{lasvegas.dat}$ are 1,000 observations on mortgages for single family homes in Las Vegas, Nevada during 2008. The variable of interest is $\\textit{DELINQUENT}$, an indicator variable $= 1$ if the borrower missed at least three payments ($90+$ days late), but $0$ otherwise. Explanatory variables: are $\\textit{LVR}=$  the ratio of the loan amount to the value of the property; $\\textit{REF}=1$ if purpose of the loan was a ‘‘refinance’’ and $=0$ if loan was for a purchase; $\\textit{INSUR}=1$ if mortgage carries mortgage insurance, $0$ otherwise; $\\textit{RATE}=$ initial interest rate of the mort- gage; $\\textit{AMOUNT}$  dollar value of mortgage (in $\\$100,000$); $\\textit{CREDIT}=$ credit score, $\\textit{TERM}=$ number of years between disbursement of the loan and the date it is expected to be fully repaid, $\\textit{ARM}=1$  if mortgage has an adjustable rate, and $=0$ if mortgage has a fixed rate."
