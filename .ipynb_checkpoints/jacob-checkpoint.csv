My online language classes also just don't compare to in-person classes.

The idea of having to articulate and write out our thoughts on the content for everyone to see may be off putting, meaning a lower volume of replies which limits how far students can engage with other viewpoints.

I used to have lectures that were 4 hours long (a slog ik) but now these have been replaced with a recorded one hour powerpoint! And my seminars were 2 hrs long and these are now online discussion boards which are hard to keep track of. THESE ARE NOT APPROPRIATE ALTERNATIVES. I feel like I am missing swathes of information that I would have received in normal classes. I know there is a value to independent research but for my subject (English literature) independent research is already a HUGE aspect of the course and I rely on the class materials to give me a starting point and give me some structure ,"No, I do not prefer online classes. I am not held to any standards because it is all available at any time online and therefore it is too easy to not turn up and participate if I deem something more important (eg an essay deadline) therefore I do not plan my time effectively. I also like meeting my professors and classmates and feeling like I have friends and support in class which is definitely lacking online. ",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

One improvement I wish to see would be to have the professors at least record the lectures in real time, so that examples provided are more current and relevant. When asking question about lectures, professors will also be able to answer questions easily because the content of the Lectures will still be in their mind from when they recorded it. With the current system, it’s ineffective because when us students ask questions regarding the lecture content, the professor will most likely not recall which part of the lecture it was from etc. because they recorded the lecture 1-2 years ago.","Since I am studying Veterinary Technology and am intending to to transfer to Veterinary Medicine, I would much prefer to have in-person classes.

The only enjoyable class I have is for chemical kinetics, where the professor records himself writing and explaining (using a drawing tablet and a special program), and the only reason I like it is beacause he's the most wholesome person I've ever met. Otherwise, watching his videos and taking notes feels very time consuming and it's not that great for motivation. As for the others, honestly, I would like it if they just sent the course materials (pdf files or powerpoint presentations) without the zoom meetings. Personally, I find it a lot easier to just study on my own and look for explanations myself, because they most certainly don't explain things very well.
I wish we used an actual learning platform, like google classroom or moodle or something of the sort. ","Absolutely not. First of all, I am a biochemistry major. Online classes means no labs. Labs are the core of anything related to chemistry, and it hinders the learning process tremendously. I would much rather go to in-person classes because I genuinely enjoy labs and experiments.
Second of all, online classes are very disorganised here. I wouldn't want them to be Minerva-style organized either, because Minerva classes rely way too much on actual participation, and it just gives me anxiety. I prefer just having the materials handed out and being left on my own to organize myself. But, at the same time, I would at least like to have a dedicated platform. The professors here use way too many different ""platforms"". Some use zoom, some use whatsapp groups, some send materials over by email (or both email and whatsapp), there's one lone professor who made a google classroom but gave us the wrong code (and she never bothered to send us the right one). It's tiring, to be honest.
There's also the fact that online classes feel very lonely. Disconnected. I liked going to class because I could sit with people I know, and we could laugh and work together on whatever it was that we had to do. I miss my lab partner, because we make a really good team and she honestly makes 3 hour long labs feel less draining.

There are a lot of people using Zoom or even WiFi networks. And nobody needs to be obliged to pay for a better service. However, there are a few professors who know this happens and do not make available the content that was given in a theoretical/practical class which is not good because if we do end up having online evaluations (for instance, final exams, another thing I am not to sure about) we need to have access to everything that was given.

Bad facts about online classes: no interaction between you and your friends, asking questions works, but is not personal, biggest point for me is that if your teacher does not stop asking but you need to ask something, interupting him/her seems rude (in class that is way more easy by raising your hand-> teacher notices that immediately). Moreover the internet connection can be bad sometimes. Good part about in-person classes: more contact with other school members (if you don't understand something, you can quickly ask for help from class members sitting next to you). Asking the teacher questions is easier in person, you can even stay after class to ask specific questions! Bad things: teachers see everything you do, how you behalte,...

However being a law student there is nothing quite like going to class and being surrounded by your peers and having discussions before class, being there physically in front of your lecturer, being able to put your hand up and debate in person with the class, have a lecturer make a joke and hear the laughter of everyone, the incessant coughing of everyone in the winter (which will be looked at a little differently now in light of corona lol), and all sorts of engagement face to face. Video lectures and zoom gets the job done and I’m not super hindered by it however nothing can ever compare to face to face interaction and there are numerous studies that show students learn far better in a face to face environment than they ever will online. There is often a disconnect between typing something up and actually physically writing something as well. I miss actual classes and can’t wait for my uni to return to real classes because so much time is spent online these days it’s ridiculous. Over platforms such as zoom you never fully get the same feeling as actually being there talking to people seeing their body language cues etc. the innovations in technology are amazing but they’re still not there, me video chatting my lecturer will never be the same as in person.

It means the teacher could call on students and ask them questions etc, it would make the whole experience more engaging and I would probably learn more from it 
I think it’s hard because a lot of my lecturers aren’t tech savvy and don’t know what they’re doing ... haha ","No
In person classes you have the option to show up, so if you do actually show up for it you’re going to pay attention, because otherwise, why would you go? 
In person classes allow you to more freely talk with the lecturers and they’re more engaging as they can clearly see if you’re on your phone or not 
You’re also able to see everyone else (hi friends I miss you :( haha)",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

It’s very hard to keep engaged with learning and finishing the college curriculum when you know there’s nothing to work towards. It’s an odd situation and we’ve all been thrown into the deep end but for year 11s, 13s and last year of uni it’s a very sad and anticlimactic ending to what should’ve and could’ve been an amazing year. We have no exams and no “results days” to look forward to so in finding it really hard to keep motivated and actually want to do any work.
